# Generative AI Application

This project is a simplified implementation of a Generative AI Application in Java. It demonstrates how to generate text using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with the DeepLearning4j library.

## Overview

The Generative AI Application uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate text character by character based on a given input. It showcases the basic principles of generative modeling and can be extended to more complex tasks such as image generation or music composition.

## Dependencies

- [DeepLearning4j](<https://deeplearning4j.org/>): A deep learning library for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/your-username/generative-ai-application.git>

```

1. **Compile and run the Java program:**
    
    ```bash
    cd generative-ai-application
    mvn compile exec:java
    
    ```
    
2. **Interact with the program:**
    - The program will generate text based on a randomly initialized input array.
    - The generated text will be displayed in the console output.

## Example

The following is an example of the generated text:

```
Generated Text: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm

```

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Training**: Train the recurrent neural network on a large dataset of text to generate more meaningful and coherent output.
- **GUI Integration**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction with the generative AI application.
- **Additional Generative Tasks**: Extend the application to perform other generative tasks such as image generation or music composition.
